I used the Scikit-learn library along with pandas, numpy and matplotlib to complete this assignment in the Python 3.6 environment.

The main file name is unsupervised_learning.py, and I recommend running it with and IDE like PyCharm to get the results.

Running the file will give you the results of my clustering metrics printed out.
Then, the plots for the dimensionality reduction algorithms will open in a new window. The plot window must be closed to let the code continue.
When the plots are displayed, the results of the clustering algorithms that were ran on the new reduced datasets will also be printed.




I obtained my datasets from UCI's Machine Learning Repository.
