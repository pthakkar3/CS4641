I used a Reinforcement Learning Simulator for this assignment.

Steps for running code:

1. Navigate into the folder called RL_sim
2. Run the executable jar file called rl_sim
3. When the program runs, select eithe Value Iteration, Policy Iteration or Q-Learning.
4. After selecting an algorithm, first select the maze that you want to solve. The two mazes that I created are called "SmallState" and "LargeState".
5. After selecting a maze, change whatever parameters you wish to change such as PJOG or Precision.
6. Click on Initialize.
7. Click on Execute (for VI or PI) or Episode (for Q Learning)
