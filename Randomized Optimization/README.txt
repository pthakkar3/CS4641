For this assignment, I used Java and created an IntelliJ project for my code. The code will be submitted as an IntelliJ project.
I used the ABAGAIL library provided to us in the assignment description as an external library in my IntelliJ project.
This made it possible for me to call functions from the ABAGAIL library in the files in my project.
The file called RandomizedOptimization.java in the src folder runs the different algorithms on the neural net and provide outputs. 
This is based on the AbaloneTest.java resource in the library, and you can just run the main function.

For the three optimization problems, I used the TravelingSalesmanTest.java, FlipFlopTest.java, and CountOnesTest.java resources from the library.
I accessed these from the ABAGAIL jar under External Libraries in my IntelliJ project, and was able to change the parameters and number of iterations from these files themselves.
To run them, you just run the main function.
